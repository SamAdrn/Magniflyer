# Magniflyer
Magniflyer is an interactive application to help users search for cheap available flights across the United States. Simply enter a destination point and Magniflyer 
will help you scan through hundreds of flights.

This application is not finished, as school has just started and I haven't really the time to make anymore updates. But the GUI on this program is a huge improvement
from my previous applications, as I tried to explore different designing aspects when doing this project. Hopefully I'll be able to finish more of it soon, but thanks 
for visiting this rep.
